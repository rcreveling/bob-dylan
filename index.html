                            <p>Woody Guthrie is widely cited as one of Dylan's most important influences. The autobiography of Guthrie, who composed "This Land Is Your Land," fell into the hands of Bob Dylan in September 1960, when he was a college student. 
                            In Dylan's memoir Chronicles, he describes reading the book; 
                            <br><br>"like a hurricane, totally focused on every word, and the book sang
                            out to me like the radio." 
                            <br><br>A few months after reading the book, Dylan told a New York crowd: 
                            <br><br>"I been travellin' around the country, followin' in Woody Guthrie's footsteps."
                            <br><br>He wrote "Song to Woody" for his 1962 album Bob Dylan, followed up by the poem "Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie," which can be heard on the album The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3: Rare & Unreleased.

                            <p>Bob Dylan was obsessed with Beat writing and the bohemian scene of the 1950s, so naturally he loved what he described as the "breathless, dynamic bop phrases" of Jack Kerouac. He said, 
                            "I read On the Road in maybe 1959. It changed my life like it changed everyone else's." In Chronicles, Dylan describes moving to Minneapolis from his remote Minnesota community for university: 
                            <br><br>"I suppose what I was looking for was what I read about in On the Road - looking for the great city, looking for the speed, the sound of it, looking for what Allen Ginsberg called the 'hydrogen jukebox world.'"
                            <br><br>Though he'd never meet Kerouac, Dylan and Ginsberg visited the writer's grave in Lowell, Massachussetts, in 1975.

                        Dylan was known for his propensity to ignore the status quo. Most, if not all, artists who have tried to follow his lead 
                        as a rebellious, original genius (or those who came before him) were unable to achieve the notoriety, esteem and respect that his person and music demanded.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                        The origin of Dylan's rebellious nature can't be pinpointed. In high school Dylan was a known delinquent, this identity being solidified in 1956 when the principal
                        of Hibbing High School forced him off the talent show stage for performing a piece by Little Richard. Dylan responded with his yearbook quote,
                        stating his life goal was to "join Little Richard."
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                        In the summer after his high school graduation, Zimmerman was working as a busboy at a Fargo, North Dakota cafe when he conned his way into a band with future music star Bobby Vee, 
                        called The Shadows, by claiming he had just been on the road with Conway Twitty and only showcasing his piano skills in the key of C. The stage name Zimmerman gave himself was Elston 
                        Gunnn. The group arrangement didn't last for very long, due to lack of funds for all involved, and Zimmerman/Gunnn left for Minneapolis at the end of the summer to attend the 
                        University of Minnesota.

                        Dylan was first signed to Columbia by John C. Hammond in a remarkable twist of fate. Hammond heard Dylan playing harmonica on Carolyn Hester's third album, 
                        entitled "Carolyn Hester" (1961) and decided on a whim, and against the judgement of his superiors, that he was record-making material. Thus Dylan's first record 
                        "Bob Dylan" was recorded, all the while Dylan (who had by now changed his name legally) continued roaming about New York City, recording under the pseudonym
                        Blind Boy Grunt for another label/magazine Broadside, meeting with the then-ill Woody Guthrie, and becoming himself as an artist.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                        But Dylan was nowhere near security in the most uncertain time in music recording history - Columbia and other big labels were trying to find contemporary sounds
                        without allowing them to develop naturally, and without knowing what exactly the world needed and wanted to hear. Dylan was perceivably novel of course, but Columbia
                        was looking for something different and strongly considered dropping Dylan before The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan was even recorded. This is when Dylan's friendship with the 
                        late Johnny Cash became one of the most vital relationships he had made to date.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                        Cash and Dylan were known to spend time together as early as 1962, when Columbia was openly discussing dropping Dylan before he even had the chance to record his famous second album 
                        The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. John Hammond claimed it 
                        was Cash’s endorsement of Dylan that helped to convince Columbia not to make a colossal mistake by dumping Dylan. In 1969, Dylan returned the favor by making his first 
                        television appearance in three years to perform on the first episode of The Johnny Cash Show.
